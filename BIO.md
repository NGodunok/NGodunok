### About Me
I am Ukrainian American, Christian, and was born in mid-2003. I'm always interested in learning new skills and honing existing 
ones, and was ititially planning to get a degree in engineering until life circumstances got in the way. So now I am exploring
this field instead, though I wouldn't mind doing more engineering focused work if the opportunity presents itself. I love the
outdoors and most forms of physical activity so my ideal job would have a mix of mental and physical work so neither body nor mind 
are as likely to get burnt out.
